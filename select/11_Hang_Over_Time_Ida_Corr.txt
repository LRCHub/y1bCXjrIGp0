Yeah it's friday night and there ain't nowhere to go
Seems kind of lonely but she's used to the cold
White Russian lover keeps her hot in his company
Just like last tuesday when he gave her a place to be

And it may seem sad when she's on the phone
Trying to explain why she's drinking all alone

It's a hangover time and she got no place to hide
'Cause she will only seek life in the bottle
It's a hangover time and she got no place to hide
She will only seek life in the bottle

Came saturday with promises of a new direction
Her hopes are high but nothing has changed into perfection
It's pouring rain maybe the water can erase her thirst
But there is one thing she just has to drink first

It may seem sad when she's on the phone
Trying to explain why she's drinking all alone

It's a hangover time and she got no place to hide
'Cause she will only seek life in the bottle
It's a hangover time and she got no place to hide
She will only seek life in the bottle

Change the beat now Girls
Emotions with mixtures of potions
Drinking and smiling now that's how she's trying
To hide her emotions with mixtures of potions
Listen now

She is all alone nowhere to run
But to the safety of her solitude
When she is crying out for attention
She will be the first one to say
She ain't worth the time anyway

And it may seem sad when she is on the phone
Trying to explain she's drinking all alone

It's hangover time no place to hide only seek life in the bottle
Hangover time no place to hide only seek life in the bottle

It's hangover time no place to hide only seek life hangover
Hangover time no place to hide only seek life in the bottle

It's hangover time no place to hide only seek life
Hangover time no place to hide only seek life

It's hangover time no place to hide only seek life hangover
Hangover time no place to hide only seek life
