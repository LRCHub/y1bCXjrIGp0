Guess you could call it cheeky
It's foul stuff
But as the night gets blurry
It's hard to get enough
Unimpressive foolish business
By which you'll fall flat
Like Christa once asked me
"Kid, aren't you smarter than that?"

Well, be it a bad habit of mine
Guess you could call it
Distance over time

Just as my head starts rushing
And time slips away
It beats me up just somewhat
But I guess I'll be okay
Knee deep in mostly nonsense
It's an eerie place
But I never crossed the line, I just took it
Right up my face

I wouldn't consider it no serious crime
Just merely
Distance over time

Oh, body's shaking
A drop of sweat
Things that were on my mind, they're now easy to forget
Countless miscalculations
Haven't slept for days
But Newton's beside me and he'll help me win this race

Could it be I'm losing my mind
From all this
Distance over time?
Everyone's got their vices so I'm
Hot-wiring with some
Distance over time, woo!
