It's another sleepless night
Without you girl
Things didn't turn out right
Time to move on

Every night the tears fall from my eyes
To wash away the loneliness
Long after your tears have dried
I'll be cryin' over time, over time

Life just seems so cold
With a lonely heart
But it's so hard to let go
Of this love that I feel for you

For every night the tears fall from my eyes
To wash away the loneliness
Until I get you off my mind
I'll be cryin' over time

See, I'm down on my knees
And I'm lonely
I need you to come back to me

Every night the tears fall from my eyes
To wash away the loneliness
Until I get you off my mind
I'll be cryin'

Can't you see what it's doing to me
You've got me cryin' over time

Hold me closely again
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
See it's come down to this
I'm down on my knees begging you
And I'm cryin' over time

Said, I need you, said I want you
I'm cryin' over time
Over time I'm cryin'
What do I got to do?

Every night that I cry too much to hide away
Feel so bad, I'll be cryin' over time
Every night that I cry too much to hide away
Feel so bad, I'll be cryin' over time

Over time
Over time
Over time
