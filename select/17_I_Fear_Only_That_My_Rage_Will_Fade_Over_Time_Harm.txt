Worlds away from what we thought
The intertwining irony of this all
As paths collide and stories cross
We live within this social paradox

Who saw it first?

Dirty hands will point their fingers first
You're not exempted from this
Cause guilty lies know where to hide

But who are you if not but good?
Just a victim to the system that sheds your blood
You shed your tears
You're shaken up
And press your fists against the very wall that you built up

Dirty hands will point their fingers first
You're not exempted from this
Cause guilty lies know where to hide

Take off your mask
Show us who you are
Just a coward, guilty as hell
Not fooling anyone

Dirty hands will point their fingers first
You're not exempted from this
Cause guilty lies know where to hide

Stay uncomfortable
Stop deflecting
Quiet your voice for once
Burn the cycle
