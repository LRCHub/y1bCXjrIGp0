Now that you're in paradise
Where you've gone to spend your life
I'll be calling over time
Though we may never unite

When will we have an hour
To try to fill the circle
If we could clear the air
Then i'd be there tonight

Loving hand turns burning sand to water
Loving hand turns burning sand to water

Now you are in paradise
Where you're bound to spend your life
I'll be calling over time
Though we never will unite

When will we clear the air
Of all our aggravation
If we could finally sink
Descend into the depths now

Loving hand turns burning sand to water
Loving hand turns burning sand to water
